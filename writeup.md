## Question 1

Take a look at the file labeled `data/phase0.txt`. Why might we have missing values or values that state "NO DATA" in this dataset? While we are currently ignoring these values, what might be the risk of filtering these values out?

There might be missing or "NO DATA" values because the tool used to measure the heart rate could have not ben functioning properly. It could have also been a user error in which the person forgot to charge device or the user took off the device so there were no data available. 

## Question 2

During sleep, we expect maximum heart rate of a phase to be **lower** than the maximum heart rate of all other phases. Observe the visualizations and descriptive statistics that you've calculated. Using these findings, in which phase does sleep occur? Mention numerical details that back your findings.


Sleep occurs during phase 0 because the maximum heart rate is 93 bpm but in phase 1, the maximum is 110 bpm. In phase 2, the maximum is 117 bpm and in phase 3 the maximum is 99 bpm.

## Question 3

During exercise, we expect the maximum heart rate of a phase to be **higher** the maximum heart rate of all other phases. Observe the visualizations and descriptive statistics that you've calculated. Using these findings, in which phase(s) does exercise occur? Mention numerical details that back your findings. 

Exerise occurs during phases 1 and 2. The maximum heart rate for phase 1 is 110 bpm and in phase 2 is 117 bpm.

## Question 4

During regular periods of awake activity, we expect the average heart rate of a phase to be relatively **lower** than the average heart rate of other phases, but we also expect standard deviation to be **higher**. In which phase do we notice this trend?

We notice this in phase 3 because the average heart rate is 60.65 bpm and the standard deviation is 11.0 bpm.
